# Advent of Code 2018

My code from Advent of Code 2018

I solved about 43/50 by the end of advent, then went back and solved the rest later (with some help from reddit).

This was may first year trying advent of code. When I saw the first puzzle, I thought I'd try solving them all in all of python, rust, and go. 
But it turned out they got much harder.

I can't say I'm especially proud of the code quality :)
